# RV3Y2_LifeHack2022
Created with CodeSandbox <br>

This was a web application built during a 24h hackathon that aims to encourage Singaporeans to cut down on unnecessary food waste. <br>

IMPORTANT: I only contributed to the routing code and some bits and pieces of code. Most code is written by other team members.
